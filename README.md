# Youtube iOS Template: No Storyboard Modification

This project is an exercise in converting an iOS app with a complex storyboard into an iOS app without storyboard. 

The project selected for this exercise was the Youtube iOS Template developed by [Haik Aslanyan](https://twitter.com/aslanyanhaik) and written in Swift 3 and can be viewed/downloaded via its repository: [Youtube iOS Template](https://github.com/aslanyanhaik/youtube-iOS)

**Youtube iOS Template** was selected due to its Storyboard with six view controllers and three specialized views.

Programmatic layout of constraints were greatly helped by [LBTA Tools](https://github.com/bhlvoong/LBTATools) by Brian Voong [@buildthatapp](https://twitter.com/buildthatapp) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/letsbuildthatapp)
